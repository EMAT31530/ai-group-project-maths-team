After two days of promising to release unedited footage of an as-yet-unaired 60 Minutes interview, during which he walked out prematurely because he was upset with Stahl’s line of questioning, the president finally followed through on Thursday. Throughout the interview, Stahl presses Trump on issues from health care (the president says he hopes the Supreme Court strikes down Obamacare, a politically toxic position) to his derogatory comments about Anthony Fauci (Trump claims he was misinterpreted) to his false claims that the Obama campaign spied on him. The tone is of an adversarial back-and-forth, well within normal journalistic bounds. Nevertheless, Trump continuously claims that Joe Biden hasn’t been given similar treatment by CBS and cuts the proceedings short.'''"
